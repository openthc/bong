## API Keys

The API Keys for this interface expire every 100 days.

> After 100 days, access from your client to the licensees data will expire. At this point, you will have to re authenticate with the licensee and receive access once more. In order to continue servicing the licensee without interruptions, it is advised that applications build this logic into their systems. Keeping track of when the refresh token will expire and possibly asking for a new authorization token prior to the expiration date.
